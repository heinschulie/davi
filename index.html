        <h1>Report on Cape Town workshop - October 12th 2016</h1>

        <p>This is a interim report of the BrightRock data visualisation project; what it is trying to do, the challenges and opportunities it faces and a discussion around initial high level concepts and how to potentially take them further. It will discuss both the medium of data visualisation and give the reader insight into where it is best employed, as well as the message the end product will hopefully land with the viewer. It will finally discuss the two approaches this project could take - with emphasis being put on the more ambitious one, albeit more risky. It will hopefully be clear that this emphasis is placed where it is because this approach creates the opportunity to deliver the intended message in a much more powerful and direct manner. 
                <br/>
            Finally the notion of this project moving beyond a brand-awareness campaign will be touched on and next steps will be suggested. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>The Medium: What is data visualisation about?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Data visualisation, at it's core, has the goal of surfacing, distilling and visually depicting inherent meaning in large sets of data. It is, to borrow the phrase, the picture that is worth a thousand numbers. It is a medium which, almost by definition, deals with broad and long views on a particular subject and one that becomes increasingly appropriate the more complex its underpinning source of data is. As such, it is a medium that is suited very well to macro-level phenomena - for instance, comparing interesting economic patterns on a demographic or societal level,mapping fluctuation in numbers of populations etc.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Beyond the linear mapping of numbers into pictures, successful data visualisation is also most successful when numbers are positioned and/or juxtaposed with each other . In another light, then, data visualisation becomes just another way to tell a story, albeit a particularly succinct and powerful one when done correctly.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>The Message: What are we trying to communicate?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            At the highest level it is understood that this project is meant to further entrench BrightRock's authority around the notion of 'Change' and 'Change moments' . More particularly, the core BrightRock positioning of 'Inherent in every change is opportunity' should be central to the origination and structuring of the narrative/experience. Finally, the key take away for the viewer/user of the visualisation should be a visceral understanding that BrightRock delivers a highly tailored, 'needs-matched' product that is demonstrably more advanced, flexible and empathetic to the individual than that of any competitors.
            <br/>
            This brief is a particularly interesting one as the medium and the intended messaging seemingly face in two opposing directions. It is believed however that this tension presents an intriguing opportunity for interaction with the viewer; an opportunity to invite the user to find their unique position within a sea of figures. This interaction could well lead to previously unexplored creative territory in the wider application of the 'Love Change' positioning as well as, ambitiously, a powerful first handshake with potential future clientele. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>The Broad Approach: Where are we now?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            As mentioned above, data visualisation is a medium that works best when dealing with large numbers or the patterns contained within them. But the BrightRock message of 'needs matched' is an intimate, human-centric one that powerfully delivers the idea that the individual is not 'just a number'. The other message is the somewhat softer, forward-looking one that change begets opportunity. There is a different but equally interesting dynamism at play here between medium and message in that the data records literally describe the past, but in doing so very often gives the viewer a convincing glimpse of what may lie ahead in the future.
            <br/>
            That leaves us at a crossroads where we take one of two possible high-level approaches: 
            <br/>
            One, we work predominantly at a macro-level and find interesting and thought-provoking patterns to illuminate through visualisation. These can be themed along the existing Change Moments and so strengthen BrightRocks authority around 'Change' . This would be quite a traditional approach to DV and as such will be an 'easy-win' that allows us to focus on the quality of the artistic rendering and potentially work with multiple artists to interpret different datasets/themes etc.
            <br/>
            An example of this kind of approach is seen below:
            <br/>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.gapminder.org/tools/#_chart-type=bubbles&state_time_end=2015&playing:true;&entities_select@_geo=mex&trailStartTime=1800;&_geo=usa&trailStartTime=1800" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <img width="560" height="315" src="http://www.prb.org/images09/OverallRateWorkplFatalities.gif" />
        <a target="_blank" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/115550/cartograms-are-important-inforgraphic-tool"><img width="560" height="315" src="https://images.newrepublic.com/578b8886074352a320d87b1ca7a7146701fd0a16.png?w=800&q=65&dpi=1&h=551" /></a>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The strength of this macro-level approach can be seen in these four simple views above. One gets a picture of the scale of Mexican emmigration into the USA, a breakdown of all immigration into the US over 200 years, a deep insight into living standards from those and other countries in those 200 years, an idea into what jobs are being occupied by these immigrants in the last 10 years till now and a very broad, but accurate, representation of how the country as a whole feels about it as ascertained by political affiliation. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
             The opportunity in applying this to the BrightRock brand would be that it could become an avenue that could lead to a broad and varied portfolio of insights into change-related subject matter - not dissimilar to the written content-strategy of the Change Exchange currently. Pieces could also be editorially produced in response to current events in a highly creative but objective manner. It's potential weakness would be that could not naturally speak much to the qualities of the BrightRock product and it's highly tailored nature. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The second approach would be one where the focus is highly individual - to the point where the user becomes the focus of the data being visualised. This is a fascinating idea as it immediately allows for the core strengths of the BrightRock product to become the structuring principles of the experience of the visualisation. Different data sets could be found / constructed that give context to the user's unique current situation and potentially provide insights into possible opportunities for growth. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p> 
            It is difficult to find examples that truly illustrate the potential but that in itself is an opportunity. One example of a project that places the viewer at the very centre of the experience is 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <a href="http://networkeffect.io/" target="_blank">The Network Effect</a>
        <br/>
        <p>
            This project borders on dystopian, but it is exceedingly well thought out and produced - and points towards a way to organise large sets of data around a end-user into a cohesive and immersive experience.  
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            To take this one step further, an interesting idea is to literally attempt to visualise the sophistication of the BrightRock product - whether that be through visual metaphor or (more aptly) the actual data and methodology. The notion of a member of the public being able to 'test drive' the BrightRock product and see how nimbly it responds to changing scenarios, using historical examples as evidence, is an exciting one…  
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Imagine a sea of undifferentiated colours on the screen - it is the BrightRock client base anonymously represented through colour and shape.  The user starts describing herself through the interface and sees the graphic starting to move. The more she outlines her present situation the more the colours starts focusing, taking shape - small points start to take definition and separating from the rest. They are people like her, where she is now in her life.  When she hovers over them insights are displayed about the people they represent, human insights that she can be relate to… this person has a two year old daughter, for instance, or that they've recently purchased a house.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Now she starts modelling what she wants from the future, her hopes - or what she doesn't want, her fears. She plays out scenarios and experience those potential futures through the data of others - and how the BrightRock product has assisted them in finding opportunity in that change by adapting to their altered situations. She experiences the intelligence of the BrightRock way of doing things by having the data visually portrayed for what it really is - the life experience of a human being. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            It is only a starting point, but this thought can be built upon and used as a framework around which to weave an ever-growing tapestry of data and 'experience' visualization.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>The Data: What are we actually going to visualise?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Along with the approach, the other seemingly obvious but nevertheless critical decision we need to make is what data will best help us relay the intended messaging to the end-user? 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p style="text-style">
            The Macro focus:  
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            If the option is taken to paint a series of high-level pictures that allow viewers to draw insights of their own on macro-level occurrences that tie back to the Change moment themes - the choice of data sources is vast and will be limited by our capacity for research.  
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            The Individual focus:   
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            It is a little early to be certain, but an interesting discussion to be had would be to what extent we could anonymise, sanitise and obscure the BrightRock product and data such that it would be safe for public use but still give the experience a visceral sense of authenticity. Further than that, organising and reinterpreting the significant amount of content in the Change Exchange is a next logical step. 
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>The Brief: Where could it go and what is needed next?</strong></p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Whether it is the high-level public data views or the showcasing of BrightRock's own intelligence - it is a really strong, thought-generating seed idea to place the viewer at the centre of the visualisation and engage them an active level. If the experience is a moving one, it could form the basis of for this visualisation moving from being a passive brand-awareness campaign to being an active leads-generation tool.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            What is needed now is a deep dive into both possible approaches, the data sets that are available and relevant and - most importantly - a deepening of understanding into how much the BrightRock product is both willing and capable of exposing to the public.
